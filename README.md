### Hi, I’m Mujeeb 👋
#### Laravel Backend Developer with Full-Stack Experience | API Specialist | TDD Enthusiast

I'm a passionate Laravel backend developer based in Nigeria. I focus on building clean, scalable web applications with **REST APIs**, **multi-tenant architecture**, and **POS integrations**. While backend is my core strength, I also work with **Inertia.js** and **React** to build full-stack Laravel apps when needed.

I care deeply about writing testable, maintainable code and shipping features that solve real-world problems.
